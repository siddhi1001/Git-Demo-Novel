chapter2
=========Abhi, while in his motherâ€™s womb, had learned how to break the Chakravyuh,
an intricate battle formation. On the thirteenth day of the great battle, 
the sixteen-year-old youth fought bravely against the experienced, much older warriors and reached the centre of
 the circular formation where Duryodhana was. The Abhi rushed to save Duryodhana and attacked Abhi. 
 Unfortunately, Abhi had not learned how to exit the formation. 
He put up a great fight and killed many great warriors before he himself was killed.
