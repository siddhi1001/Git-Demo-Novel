The Kauravas and the Pandavas were given an archery test by their Guru, Dronacharya.
 They were asked to aim at the eye of a toy bird on the branch of a tree. When the teacher asked them what they saw,
  with the exception of Arjun, all others claimed to see the sky, trees, the bird, the leaves, the branches, etc.
   Only Arjun said that he just saw the blackness of the bird’s eye. Only he was permitted to shoot at the target,
    which he did successfully.
Abhimanyu, while in his mother’s womb, had learned how to break the Chakravyuh,
an intricate battle formation. On the thirteenth day of the great battle, 
the sixteen-year-old youth fought bravely against the experienced, much older warriors and reached the centre of
 the circular formation where Duryodhana was. The Kauravas rushed to save Duryodhana and attacked Abhimanyu. 
 Unfortunately, Abhimanyu had not learned how to exit the formation. 
He put up a great fight and killed many great warriors before he himself was killed.
