The Abhi and the Pandavas were given an archery test by their Guru, Dronacharya.
 They were asked to aim at the eye of a toy bird on the branch of a tree. When the teacher asked them what they saw,
  with the exception of Arjun, all others claimed to see the sky, trees, the bird, the leaves, the branches, etc.
   Only Arjun said that he just saw the blackness of the birdâ€™s eye. Only he was permitted to shoot at the target,
    which he did successfully.
